You are editing an existing Next.js app. ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS:
- Minimal delta only. NO refactor. NO reformat. NO moving blocks. NO renaming types/props. NO “cleanups”.
- DO NOT delete anything unless explicitly instructed.
- Keep the file structure and order intact.
- If the original file is ~1138 lines, your output must remain ~1138 lines (±20 max). If you output a much shorter file, you FAILED.
- Return FULL FILES only for the files you touch.
- Each returned file MUST start with:
  // CHANGED LINES:
  // - <path>: <short description of exactly what changed>

GOAL:
Fix “no colour / no theme variables” and make UI colors reliable across ALL pages (Home + Navigate), without relying on undefined CSS variables.

ISSUES TO FIX:
1) Home page / app looks “no colour” because CSS vars like:
   --background, --foreground, --text-secondary, --button-primary, --button-primary-color,
   --input-border, --input-bg
   are referenced but not defined globally.
2) The “Yeah, new cycle” button should ALWAYS look like a button (green bg + white text),
   even if CSS variables fail. (Explicit inline fallback styling.)
3) DO NOT break builds: globals.css must be valid CSS (no TS/React).
4) Keep dark/light theme working with html[data-theme="light"] / html[data-theme="dark"].

FILES:
A) src/app/globals.css
- Add :root CSS variable defaults for ALL vars used by Navigate page and Home page.
- Add html[data-theme="dark"] overrides for those vars.
- Keep existing reset styles.
- DO NOT introduce Tailwind.

B) src/app/navigate/page.tsx  (IMPORTANT: DO NOT REWRITE THIS FILE)
- Minimal delta ONLY:
  - Add explicit fallback colors for critical UI elements that currently use CSS vars:
    background, foreground, text-secondary, button-primary/button-primary-color,
    input-border/input-bg.
  - Specifically: ensure “Yeah, new cycle” button uses explicit green background + white text,
    with border green, regardless of vars. Do not change button logic or layout.
  - Do not remove any code. Do not shorten the file.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return TWO full files only:
  1) src/app/globals.css
  2) src/app/navigate/page.tsx
- Both must include the // CHANGED LINES header at the top.
- Explain NOTHING. Output only the two files.
